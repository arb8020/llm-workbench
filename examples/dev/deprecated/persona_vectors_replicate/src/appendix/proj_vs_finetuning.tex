 In Figure~\ref{fig:data_vs_finetune}, we plot the dataset-level \textit{projection difference} \( \Delta P \) against the observed \textit{finetuning shift} along various persona directions. We observe a positive correlation: datasets with larger projection differences tend to induce greater shifts in the persona direction during finetuning.  This suggests that projection difference serves as a useful predictive signal for assessing potential persona shifts prior to finetuning.
