After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jared's typing speed starts at 47 WPM and increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. Then he continues to increase it by 5 words more. We need to find the average of the three measurements. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the problem. There are three measurements: the first was 47, the second was 52, and the third is 52 + 5 = 57. Then, average is total divided by number of measurements. So total would be 47 + 52 + 57, and divide by 3. \n\nLet me check the numbers again. Starting at 47, then 52, then adding 5. So yes, 57. Then adding those numbers. Let me compute that. 47 plus 52 is 99, plus 57. So 99 + 57 equals 156. Then average is 156 divided by 3. \n\nHmm, 156 divided by 3. Let me do that division. 3 times 50 is 150, so 156 minus 1"}
