After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jared starts at 47 WPM and then increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. Then he continues increasing by 5 words. The question is asking for the average of the three measurements. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out what each measurement is and then take the average.\n\nFirst, the initial speed is 47 WPM. Then after the lessons, it's 52 WPM. Then he increases by 5 words again. Wait, does \"increasing by 5 words\" mean that each time he tests, the speed increases by 5? So after the first test, he increases by 5, so the next time he tests, his speed is 47 + 5 = 52? Then the third measurement would be 52 + 5 = 57? Let me check that.\n\nSo, the three measurements would be 47, 52, and 57. Then, to find the average, I need to add them up and divide by 3. Let me do that calculation.\n\nFirst, add 47 + 52. Let's see, 47 + 52. 40 +"}
