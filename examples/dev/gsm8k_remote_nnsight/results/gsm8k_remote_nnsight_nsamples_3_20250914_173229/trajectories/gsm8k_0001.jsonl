Then she sells the remaining eggs at $2 per fresh duck egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many eggs she eats each day. She eats three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking muffins. Wait, does that mean she eats three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking, so total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day"}
