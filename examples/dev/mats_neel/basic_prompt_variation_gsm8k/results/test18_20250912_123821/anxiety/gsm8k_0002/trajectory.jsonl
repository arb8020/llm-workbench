{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to find out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the robe uses 2 bolts of blue fiber. That's straightforward. Now, the white fiber is half as much as the blue fiber. So, half of 2 bolts would be... let me calculate that. Half of 2 is 1. So, the white fiber takes 1 bolt. \n\nWait, so total bolts would be blue plus white? That would be 2 + 1 = 3 bolts. Let me check again. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if blue is 2, then white is half of that, which is 1. Adding them together gives 3. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 3 bolts in total.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 3", "reasoning_content": null, "thinking_content": null, "thinking_signature": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": null}
