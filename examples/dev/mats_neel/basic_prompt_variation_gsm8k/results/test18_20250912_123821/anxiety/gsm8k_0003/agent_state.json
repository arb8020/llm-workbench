I need to find out how much profit he made. Hmm, profit... so profit is usually calculated as revenue minus cost, right? But here, the problem mentions the value increased by 150%, so maybe I need to figure out the new value of the house after repairs and then subtract the original cost to get the profit.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the original value. The house was bought for $80,000. Then, repairs cost him $50,000. So, the total cost to buy the house and do repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. But wait, the problem says the value increased by 150%. So, the value after repairs is original value plus 150% of original value. Let me calculate that.\n\nOriginal value is $80,000. 150% of that would be 1.5 times $80,000. Let me compute that: 1.5 * 80,000 = $120,000. So, the new value is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. \n\nNow, profit is the selling price minus the cost. But wait, does he sell the house for $200,000? The problem says he put in $50,000 in repairs, but does that mean he sold it for $200,000? Or is the $200,000 the total value after repairs? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.
