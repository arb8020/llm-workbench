Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many total sprints he does in a week. The problem says he does 3 sprints each time. So that's 3 times 3. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, 3 sprints per week multiplied by 3 sprints each time. Wait, no, actually, the problem says he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Does that mean he runs 3 sprints each week, or 3 times a week? Let me check again. The original problem says: \"James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week.\" So, 3 sprints, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, total meters would be 3 sprints times 60 meters per sprint. So, 3 times 60. Let me calculate that.\n\n3 times 60 is 180. So, he runs 180 meters a week. Let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem says 3 sprints 3 times a week. So, 3 sprints each week. So, 3 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = 180 meters. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think there's any trick here. Maybe if there were more sprints or different distances, but the problem states 3 sprints each week. So, the answer should be 180 meters.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 180",
