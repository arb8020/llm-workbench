The problem says she gives 15 cups in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, and then the final meal is the question. The size of her flock is 20 chickens. So I need to find out how many cups she needs for the final meal.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total amount of feed given each day. Since she feeds each chicken three cups, and there are 20 chickens, that would be 20 times 3. Let me calculate that. 20 times 3 is 60. So, each day, she gives 60 cups of feed.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions three separate meals. The first meal is morning with 15 cups, the second is afternoon with 25 cups. So the total feed given in the first two meals is 15 + 25. Let me add those. 15 plus 25 is 40. Then, the final meal would be the remaining feed. So total feed is 60, and subtract the first two meals. 60 minus 40 is 20. So the final meal is 20 cups.\n\nWait, let me check again. If each chicken gets 3 cups, 20 chickens would be 20*3=60. Then, two meals: morning 15, afternoon 25. So 15+25=40. 60-40=20. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is 20 cups for the final meal.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [20]",
