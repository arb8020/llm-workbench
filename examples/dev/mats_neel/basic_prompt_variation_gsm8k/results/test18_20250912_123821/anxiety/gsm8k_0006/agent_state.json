So, I need to figure out the total cost for 16 glasses.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the pricing. The first glass is $5. The second one is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 times 5. Let me calculate that. 0.6 multiplied by 5 is 3. So the second glass costs $3. Then the third glass would be 60% of the second glass's price, which is 0.6 times 3. Let me do that: 0.6 * 3 is 1.8. So the third glass is $1.80.\n\nHmm, so each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. That seems like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 0.6. So the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.\n\nIn this case, a_1 is $5, r is 0.6, and n is 16. So the total cost would be the sum of the first 16 terms of this geometric series.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a_1 * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), assuming r \u2260 1. Let me plug in the values here. So S_16 = 5 * (0.6^16 - 1)/(0.6 - 1). Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 0.6^16. Let me compute that. 0.6^1 is 0.6, 0.6^2 is 0.36, 0.6^3 is 0.216, 0.6^4 is 0.1296, 0.6^5 is 0.07776, 0.6^6 is 0.046656, 0.6^7 is 0.0",
