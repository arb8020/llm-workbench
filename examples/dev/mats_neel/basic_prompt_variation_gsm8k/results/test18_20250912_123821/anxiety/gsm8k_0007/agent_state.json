Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. And Seattle has 20 sheep. The question is asking how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by writing down what each person has in terms of Seattle's sheep. Since Seattle has 20, then Charleston has 4 times that. Let me check: 4 times 20 is 80. So Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nThen, Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston. So that would be 2 times 80. Let me calculate that. 2 times 80 is 160. So Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, to find the total number of sheep for all three, I need to add up Toulouse's, Charleston's, and Seattle's sheep. So that would be 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle). Let me add those numbers. 160 plus 80 is 240, and then adding 20 more makes it 260. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Seattle's sheep: 20. Then Charleston's: 4*20=80. Toulouse's: 2*80=160. Total: 160+80+20. Yes, that adds up to 260. \n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 260.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 260",
