Then, Windows restarts, which takes 20 minutes, and then she has to start from the beginning. The question is asking how much load it takes to download the file. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total time taken, including the restart and the time she spends downloading normally.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. Normally, the download speed is 2 GB per minute. But since she's halfway through, the download is only half the file. Wait, but does that mean she can only download half the file at 2 GB per minute? Or does the 2 GB per minute apply to the entire download? Let me think. The problem says she can download 2 GB/minute normally. But when she's halfway through, there's a restart. So maybe the download speed is reduced to 2 GB/minute, but the restart takes 20 minutes. Then she restarts from the beginning. So the total time would be the time to download half the file normally, plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download the remaining half again.\n\nWait, but does the restart affect the download speed? The problem says that when she's halfway through, Windows forces a restart. So maybe the download speed is still 2 GB per minute, but the restart takes 20 minutes. Then she restarts from the beginning. So the total time would be:\n\nTime to download half the file normally: (200 / 2) minutes = 100 minutes.\n\nThen, the restart takes 20 minutes. Then, she has to restart from the beginning, so she has to download the remaining half again. So that's another 100 minutes. So total time is 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 minutes. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but maybe the restart doesn't affect the download speed. So maybe the download speed is still 2 GB per minute, but the restart takes 20 minutes.
