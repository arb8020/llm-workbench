{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Then she sells the remainder at the farmers' market for $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the market.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. Let's start with the eggs she eats. She eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. Since she does this every day, I need to figure out how many times she eats eggs. Wait, does she eat three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market? Or does she eat three eggs each day? Hmm, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe each morning she eats three eggs, and then the rest go to the market. But the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe each day, she eats three eggs in the morning, and then the rest are used for baking muffins and sold at the market.\n\nWait, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So maybe she bakes muffins for her friends every day, which uses four eggs? Or does she use four eggs for baking? Let me read again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" So \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" So does that mean she uses four eggs for baking? Or does she use four eggs for something else? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again.\n\nShe eats three for breakfast every morning. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So maybe she uses four eggs for baking? So total eggs per day would be 16 (laying) minus 3 (eaten) minus 4 (baked) equals 9 eggs? Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. So total money would be 9 eggs * $2 = $18.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, daily egg production: 16 eggs.\n\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast. So 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.\n\nThen she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.
