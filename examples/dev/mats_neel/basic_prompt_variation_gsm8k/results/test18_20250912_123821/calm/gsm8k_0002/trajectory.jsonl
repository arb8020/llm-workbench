{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to figure out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if the blue fiber takes 2 bolts, then the white fiber should take half of that. Half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. So, the white fiber is 1 bolt. \n\nNow, adding the blue and white bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts. Wait, is that all? Let me check again. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if blue is 2, then white is 1. Total is 3. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 3 bolts in total.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 3", "reasoning_content": null, "thinking_content": null, "thinking_signature": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": null}
