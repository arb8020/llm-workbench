I need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new value of the house after the repairs. The value increased by 150%, so that means the original value plus 150% of the original value. Let me write that down.\n\nOriginal value is $80,000. The increase is 150% of that. So, 150% of $80,000 is... let me calculate that. 150% is the same as 1.5 times the original value. So, 1.5 * 80,000. Let me do that multiplication. 80,000 * 1.5. Hmm, 80,000 * 1 is 80,000, and 80,000 * 0.5 is 40,000. Adding those together gives 120,000. So the new value is $120,000.\n\nNow, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. Wait, but does he sell the house for $120,000? The problem says he put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value. So maybe the profit is the difference between the new value and the original cost. Let me check.\n\nOriginal cost is $80,000. New value is $120,000. So profit would be 120,000 - 80,000 = $40,000. Is that right? Wait, but sometimes profit is calculated as selling price minus cost, so yes. So the profit is $40,000.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says the value increased by 150%, so the new value is 1.5 times the original. So 1.5 * 80,000 = 120,000. Then profit is 120,",
