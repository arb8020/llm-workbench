{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. James runs 3 sprints a week, and each sprint is 60 meters. I need to find out how many meters he runs in a week. Hmm, so first, I should multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint. \n\nSo, 3 sprints times 60 meters per sprint. Let me do the multiplication. 3 times 60... Well, 3 times 60 is 180. So, that would be 180 meters per week. \n\nWait, let me check again. If he runs 3 times a week, and each time 60 meters, then yes, 3 times 60 is definitely 180. I don't think there's any trick here. Maybe there's something else, but the problem seems straightforward. \n\nSo, the answer should be 180 meters. Let me make sure there's no misunderstanding. The problem says \"total meters he runs a week,\" so multiplying the number of sprints by the distance per sprint gives the total. Yep, that makes sense. \n\nAnswer: 180\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 180", "reasoning_content": null, "thinking_content": null, "thinking_signature": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": null}
