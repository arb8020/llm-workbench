She has 20 chickens, so I need to figure out how many cups she needs for each meal. \n\nFirst, the problem says she gives each chicken 3 cups. So, if there are 20 chickens, then 20 multiplied by 3. Let me check that. 20 chickens times 3 cups per chicken. \n\nWait, but the problem mentions three separate meals. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, afternoon 25 cups. So maybe the total feed per day is 15 + 25, and then multiplied by 20 chickens? Or is it just per chicken? Let me read again.\n\n\"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\"\n\nSo, the key here is that each chicken gets 3 cups. The total feed per day is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Then, since there are 20 chickens, each getting 3 cups, total feed would be 20 * 3 = 60 cups. But wait, the problem says she gives three separate meals. So maybe the total feed per day is 15 + 25 = 40, and then multiplied by 20 chickens? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 15 and 25 are per meal, and each meal is for all chickens. So first meal: 15 cups for 20 chickens, second meal: 25 cups for 20 chickens. Then total per day would be 15 + 25 = 40, and then multiplied by 20? Wait, but that would be 40 * 20 = 800? But that seems way too high. Wait, no, because each meal is for all chickens. So if each chicken gets 3 cups, then per meal,",
