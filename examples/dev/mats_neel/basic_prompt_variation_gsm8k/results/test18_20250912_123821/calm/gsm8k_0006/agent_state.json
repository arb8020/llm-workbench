Hmm, so the prices are not all the same. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the cost for each glass. The first one is $5. The second one is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 times 5. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3. So the second glass costs $3. Then the third glass would be 60% of the second one, which is 0.6 times 3. Let me do that: 0.6 * 3 is 1.8. So the third glass is $1.80. \n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. So the prices are $5, $3, $1.80, $1.08, $0.648, and so on. Wait, but does this pattern continue infinitely? Or does it stop after 16 glasses? The problem says he wants to buy 16 glasses, so I need to calculate up to the 16th one.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula here. Since each glass is 60% of the previous one, this is a geometric sequence where the first term (a) is $5, and the common ratio (r) is 0.6. The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a_n = a * r^(n-1). So for the 16th glass, the cost would be 5 * (0.6)^(15). Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total cost by summing the first 16 terms of the geometric series. Let me verify that approach as well. Let's see, the sum S_n = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1). Plugging in a = 5, r = 0.6, n = 16. So S_16 = 5 * (0.6^16 - 1)/(0.6 - 1). Let me compute that.\n\nBut maybe I should calculate each term",
