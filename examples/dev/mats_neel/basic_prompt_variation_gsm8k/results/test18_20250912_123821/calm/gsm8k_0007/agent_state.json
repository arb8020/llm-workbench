Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. And Seattle has 20 sheep. The question is asking how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together.\n\nFirst, I should probably start by writing down what each person has in terms of variables. Let me assign variables to each person's sheep. Let me call Seattle's sheep S. According to the problem, Seattle has 20 sheep, so S = 20.\n\nThen, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So Charleston's sheep would be 4 times S. Since S is 20, that would be 4 * 20. Let me calculate that. 4 times 20 is 80. So Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nNow, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So Toulouse's sheep would be 2 times Charleston's. Since Charleston has 80, Toulouse has 2 * 80. Let me compute that. 2 times 80 is 160. So Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together. So I need to add up all three numbers: Toulouse (160), Charleston (80), and Seattle (20). Let me add them up step by step.\n\nFirst, add Toulouse and Charleston: 160 + 80. Let me do that. 160 + 80 is 240. Then add Seattle's 20 to that. So 240 + 20 is 260. Therefore, the total number of sheep is 260.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\nSeattle has 20. Charleston is 4 times that, so 4*20=80. Toulouse is twice as many as Charleston, so 2*80=160. Total is 160+80+20. Yes, 160+80 is 240, plus 20 is 260. That seems correct.\n\nI",
