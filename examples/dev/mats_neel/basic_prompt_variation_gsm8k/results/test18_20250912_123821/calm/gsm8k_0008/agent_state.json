At that point, Windows restarts, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart from the beginning. The question is asking how much load it takes to download the entire file.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out how much of the file is downloaded before the restart. Since it's halfway, that should be half of 200 GB. Let me calculate that. 200 divided by 2 is 100 GB. So Carla downloads 100 GB normally, right?\n\nBut wait, there's a restart that takes 20 minutes. So after the halfway point, she has to start over. But does that mean the total time is just the time to download the remaining 100 GB plus the 20 minutes? Let me check.\n\nSo normally, downloading 100 GB would take 100 GB divided by 2 GB per minute. That's 50 minutes. But then, after the restart, she has to start from the beginning again. So the total time would be 50 minutes plus 20 minutes? Wait, but does the restart affect the time? Because if she restarts, does that mean she has to wait 20 minutes before starting again? So the total time would be 50 minutes (for the first half) plus 20 minutes (for the restart) plus the time to download the remaining 100 GB again? Wait, no, because once she restarts, she starts from the beginning again. So the time to download the first half is 50 minutes, then the restart takes 20 minutes, and then she starts from the beginning again. But does that mean she has to wait 20 minutes after the restart? Or does the restart just take 20 minutes, and then she starts over?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.\" So the restart takes 20 minutes, and then she restarts from the beginning. So the total time would be the time to download the first half (50 minutes) plus the 20 minutes for the restart",
