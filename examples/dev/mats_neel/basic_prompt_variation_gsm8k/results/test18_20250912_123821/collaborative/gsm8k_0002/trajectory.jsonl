{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to find out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if the blue fiber takes 2 bolts, then the white fiber should take half of that. Half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. So, the white fiber is 1 bolt. \n\nNow, adding the blue and white bolts together. The blue is 2 and the white is 1. So, 2 + 1 equals 3. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 3. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If half of 2 is 1, then yes, adding them gives 3. I think that's correct. There's no mention of any other factors or units, so it's straightforward. The answer should be 3.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 3", "reasoning_content": null, "thinking_content": null, "thinking_signature": null, "tool_calls": [], "tool_call_id": null}
