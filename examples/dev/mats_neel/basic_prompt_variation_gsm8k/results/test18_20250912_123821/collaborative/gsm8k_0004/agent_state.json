Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many total meters he runs in each sprint and then multiply by the number of sprints per week. \n\nWait, right. So each sprint is 60 meters. If he does 3 sprints a week, then total meters would be 3 times 60. Let me check that. 3 multiplied by 60... Let me calculate that. 3 times 60 is 180. So does that mean he runs 180 meters a week?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says he runs 3 sprints 3 times a week. So 3 sprints times 60 meters per sprint equals 180 meters. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer should be 180 meters. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It's straightforward multiplication. So the answer is 180.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 180",
