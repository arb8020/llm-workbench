The problem says she gives 15 cups in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, and then we need to find out how many cups are in the final meal. The flock size is 20 chickens. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount of feed given each meal. The problem mentions that each chicken gets three cups. So, if there are 20 chickens, then each chicken would get 3 cups. But wait, the problem says she gives three separate meals. So maybe each meal is for all the chickens? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\"\n\nSo, each meal is for all the chickens. So, first meal: 15 cups. Second meal: 25 cups. Then the final meal? Wait, but the problem says she gives three separate meals. So maybe the first two meals are 15 and 25, and the third is the final one? But the problem says \"the final meal of the day\". So maybe the total feed per day is 15 + 25 + (final meal). But the problem says she feeds each chicken three cups. So if there are 20 chickens, then each chicken gets 3 cups. Therefore, total feed per day would be 20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups. But then, how many meals are there? Three meals. So if each meal is for all chickens, then total feed per day would be 15 + 25 + (final meal). But the problem says she gives three separate meals. So maybe the first two meals are 15 and 25, and the third is the final meal. But the problem doesn't specify how many cups per meal. Wait,",
