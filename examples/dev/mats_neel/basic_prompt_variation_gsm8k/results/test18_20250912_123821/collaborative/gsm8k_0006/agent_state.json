Hmm, so the prices are not all the same. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the price of each glass. The first one is $5. The second one is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 times 5. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3. So the second glass costs $3. Then the third glass would be 60% of the second one, which is 0.6 times 3. Let me do that: 0.6 * 3 = 1.8. So the third glass is $1.80. \n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. So the prices are $5, $3, $1.80, $1.08, $0.648, and so on. Wait, but does this pattern continue infinitely? Or does it stop at 16 glasses? The problem says he wants to buy 16 glasses, so I need to calculate up to the 16th one.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula or a way to calculate the total cost without listing all the prices. Let me think. Since each glass is 60% of the previous one, starting from $5, the prices form a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 0.6. The first term a is $5, and the common ratio r is 0.6.\n\nThe sum S of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r). Let me confirm that formula. Yes, for a geometric series with first term a and ratio r, the sum up to n terms is S = a*(1 - r^n)/(1 - r). So here, a is $5, r is 0.6, and n is 16.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So S = 5*(1 - 0.6^16)/(1 - 0.6). Let me compute that. First, calculate 0.6^16. Hmm,",
