Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?\"\n\nAlright, so the problem is about finding the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. They give me that Seattle has 20 sheep. Then, there are relationships between the numbers of sheep in each city.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. Let me assign variables to each of these cities to make it easier. Let me call Seattle's sheep number S. According to the problem, S is 20. So S = 20.\n\nThen, Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So if Seattle has 20, then Charleston has 4 * 20. Let me calculate that. 4 times 20 is 80. So Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nNext, Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So Toulouse's sheep number is twice that of Charleston. Since Charleston has 80, Toulouse has 2 * 80. Let me compute that. 2 times 80 is 160. So Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the total number of sheep in all three cities: Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle. So I need to add up their sheep numbers: 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle).\n\nLet me add those numbers step by step. First, 160 + 80. Let me do that. 160 + 80 is 240. Then, adding 20 to that total. 240 + 20 is 260. So the total is 260 sheep.\n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again.\n\nSeattle has 20. Charleston is 4 times Seattle, so 4 * 20 = 80. Toulouse is twice Charleston, so 2 * 80 = 160. Total is 160 + 80 +",
