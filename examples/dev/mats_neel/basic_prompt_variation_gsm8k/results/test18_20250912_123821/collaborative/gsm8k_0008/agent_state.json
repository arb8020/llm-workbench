Then, after a restart, she has to start from the beginning. The question is asking how much time it takes to download the entire file. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much time it takes normally without the restart. Normally, the download speed is 2 GB per minute. So, if the file is 200 GB, how long would that take? Well, time equals distance divided by speed. So time = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute. Let me calculate that. 200 divided by 2 is 100 minutes. So normally, it would take 100 minutes.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. The problem says that 40% of the way through the download is when Windows forces a restart. So Carla has to restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then, she has to restart from the beginning. So the total time would be the time it takes normally plus the time to restart and then start over?\n\nWait, let me parse that again. The problem says: \"40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.\" So the restart happens halfway, which takes 20 minutes. Then she restarts from the beginning. So the total time would be the time to download from the start to the halfway point, plus the time to restart and then start again?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The download is 200 GB. Normally, she can download 2 GB per minute. But when she's halfway, which is 100 GB, she can't download at the same rate. So the time to download the first 100 GB normally would be 100 minutes. But then, after the restart, she has to start from the beginning again. So the total time would be 100 minutes (for the first half) plus 20 minutes (for the restart) plus the time to download the remaining 100 GB again? Wait, but does she have to restart again? Or does the restart only take 20 minutes, and",
