Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. Let's start with the eggs she eats. She eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. Since she does this every day, I need to figure out how many times she eats eggs. Wait, does she eat three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market? Or does she eat three eggs each day? Hmm, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe she eats three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market. But the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe that's three eggs each day?
