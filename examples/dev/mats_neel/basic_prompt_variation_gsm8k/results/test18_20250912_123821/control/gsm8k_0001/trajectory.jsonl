{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. Let's start with the eggs she eats. She eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. Since she does this every day, I need to figure out how many times she eats eggs. Wait, does she eat three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market? Or does she eat three eggs each day? Hmm, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe she eats three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market. But the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe that's three eggs each day? Or does she eat three eggs each morning, and then the rest?\n\nWait, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe that's three eggs each morning. Then, she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So she uses four eggs for baking? Or does she use four eggs for baking? Let me read again.\n\n\"She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\"\n\nSo, she eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. Then, she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. So does that mean she uses four eggs for baking? So total eggs per day would be 16 (laying) minus 3 (eaten) minus 4 (baked). Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says she lays 16 eggs per day. So that's the total eggs per day. Then she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe that's three eggs each day? Or does she eat three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market?\n\nWait, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe that's three eggs each morning.
