I need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value is $80,000, and the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, I think I need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value.\n\nSo, 150% of $80,000. Let me convert that percentage to a decimal. 150% is the same as 1.5. So, 1.5 multiplied by $80,000. Let me do that calculation. 80,000 times 1.5. Hmm, 80,000 times 1 is 80,000, and 80,000 times 0.5 is 40,000. Adding those together gives 120,000. So the new value is $120,000.\n\nNow, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. The problem says he bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. Wait, does that mean he sold the house for $120,000 and made a profit of $70,000? Let me check. If the new value is $120,000, and he spent $50,000 on repairs, then the profit would be the selling price minus the cost. But hold on, does he sell the house for the same amount as the new value? Or is the $50,000 repair part of the cost?\n\nWait, the problem says he buys the house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. So, maybe he spent $80,000 on the house and $50,000 on repairs, making the total cost $130,000. Then the profit would be the selling price minus the total",
