Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many total meters he runs in a week. \n\nSince he runs 3 sprints each week, and each sprint is 60 meters, I think I need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint. That makes sense because if you have 3 sprints, and each is 60 meters, you just add them up. \n\nSo, 3 sprints multiplied by 60 meters per sprint. Let me write that out: 3 * 60. Let me do the multiplication. 3 times 60... Well, 3 times 60 is 180. So, James runs 180 meters a week. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If he runs 3 times a week, and each time 60 meters, then yes, 3 times 60 is indeed 180. I don't think there's any trick here. The problem seems straightforward. \n\nSo, the answer should be 180 meters. And the final line must be \"Answer: [your numeric answer]\". So putting it all together, the answer is 180.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [180]",
