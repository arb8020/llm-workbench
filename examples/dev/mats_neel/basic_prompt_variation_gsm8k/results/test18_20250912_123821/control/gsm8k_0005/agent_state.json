So first, I need to figure out how many cups of feed she needs for all the chickens in total. \n\nWait, the problem says she gives each chicken three cups. So if there are 20 chickens, then 20 multiplied by 3. Let me check that. Yeah, that makes sense. So 20 times 3 is 60. So that would be the total cups needed for all the meals. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions three separate meals: morning, afternoon, and final meal. But the question is asking for the final meal. So maybe I need to calculate the total feed first and then divide by the number of meals? Wait, no, because each meal is three cups. Wait, no, each chicken gets three cups per meal. So if there are 20 chickens, and each gets three cups, then total feed is 20 * 3. But the problem says she gives them three separate meals. So maybe the total feed is 20 chickens * 3 cups per meal. But then again, the problem says she gives them three separate meals. So maybe each meal is three cups. \n\nWait, let me read again. \"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy. She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\"\n\nSo the key here is that each chicken gets three cups per meal. So if there are 20 chickens, and each gets three cups, then total per day is 20 * 3. But the problem is asking for the final meal. So maybe the total feed is 20 * 3, which is 60 cups. Then divided by three meals? Wait, but if each meal is three cups, then total per meal is 3 cups. So if there are three meals, then total feed is 3 * 3 = 9 cups per day?",
