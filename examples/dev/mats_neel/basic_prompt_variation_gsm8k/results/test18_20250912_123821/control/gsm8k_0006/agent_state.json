Hmm, so the prices are not all the same. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first glass is $5. Then, the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 times 5. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3. So the second glass costs $3. Then the third glass would be 60% of the second one, which is 0.6 times 3. Let me do that: 0.6 * 3 is 1.8. So the third glass is $1.80. \n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. So the prices are $5, $3, $1.80, $1.08, $0.648, and so on. Wait, but does this pattern continue infinitely? Or does it stop at 16 glasses? The problem says he wants to buy 16 glasses, so I need to calculate up to the 16th one.\n\nLet me list them out step by step:\n\n1. 5.00\n2. 5 * 0.6 = 3.00\n3. 3 * 0.6 = 1.80\n4. 1.80 * 0.6 = 1.08\n5. 1.08 * 0.6 = 0.648\n6. 0.648 * 0.6 = 0.3888\n7. 0.3888 * 0.6 = 0.2333\n8. 0.2333 * 0.6 = 0.1400\n9. 0.1400 * 0.6 = 0.0840\n10. 0.0840 * 0.6 = 0.0504\n11. 0.0504 * 0.6 = 0.03024\n",
