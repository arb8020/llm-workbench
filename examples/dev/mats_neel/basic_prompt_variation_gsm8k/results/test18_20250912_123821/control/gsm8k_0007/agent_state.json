We need to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Seattle has 20 sheep.\n- Charleston has 4 times as many as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20, then Charleston's sheep would be 4 * 20. Let me calculate that. 4 times 20 is 80. So Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nNext, Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston. Since we just found out that Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse's sheep would be 2 * 80. Let me compute that. 2 times 80 is 160. So Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, to find the total number of sheep for all three cities, we need to add up Toulouse's, Charleston's, and Seattle's sheep. So that would be 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle). Let me add those numbers. 160 + 80 is 240, and then adding 20 more gives 260. \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nStarting with Seattle: 20 sheep. \n\nCharleston: 4 times 20 is 80. Correct. \n\nToulouse: 2 times 80 is 160. Correct. \n\nTotal: 160 + 80 + 20. Let's add them in a different way. 160 + 80 is 240, plus 20 is 260. Yep, that seems right. \n\nSo the answer should be 260. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"how many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together\". So yes, adding them all up. \n\nI think that's all. No steps missed. The answer is 260.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [260]",
