Windows restarts her, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart from the beginning. The question is asking how much load it takes to download the file. Hmm, so I need to calculate the total time taken, including the restart time and the time she spends downloading normally.\n\nFirst, let me break down the problem. Normally, the download speed is 2 GB per minute. But since she's halfway through, maybe the download speed is slower? Wait, the problem says she can download 2 GB/minute normally. But when she's halfway, there's a restart. So does that mean that during the download, she can only download at 2 GB per minute until halfway, then the restart takes 20 minutes, and then she starts again from the beginning?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.\" So maybe the download is 200 GB. Let me think. If she's halfway, that's 100 GB. So normally, she would download 100 GB in 50 minutes (since 2 GB/min * 50 minutes = 100 GB). But then there's a restart that takes 20 minutes. So total time would be 50 minutes plus 20 minutes, which is 70 minutes. But then she restarts from the beginning. Wait, but does she have to restart from the beginning? The problem says \"then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.\" So maybe the total time is the time to download the first half (50 minutes) plus the restart time (20 minutes) plus the time to download the second half (which is 100 GB at 2 GB/min, so 50 minutes again). So total time would be 50 + 20 + 50 = 120 minutes. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the restart takes 20 minutes, and then she starts from the beginning. So the total time is the time to download the entire 200 GB, which would be 200 /",
