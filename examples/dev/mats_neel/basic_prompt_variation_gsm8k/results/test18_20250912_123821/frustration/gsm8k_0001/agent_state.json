Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the market.\n\nFirst, let me break down the problem. The total eggs per day are 16. She eats three for breakfast, so that's 3 eggs. Then she bakes muffins for her friends, which uses four eggs. Wait, does that mean she uses four eggs for the muffins? So, does that mean she uses 4 eggs for the muffins, and then the remaining eggs go to the market?\n\nWait, let me parse that again. \"She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" Hmm. So, does \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" mean that she uses four eggs for the muffins? So, total eggs per day are 16. She eats 3 for breakfast, then uses 4 for muffins. So, the remaining eggs would be 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs. Then she sells those 9 eggs at $2 per egg. So total money made would be 9 * 2 = $18.\n\nWait, let me check again. Total eggs per day: 16. She eats 3 for breakfast, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left. Then she bakes muffins with four eggs. So 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left. Then sells 9 eggs at $2 each. So 9 * 2 = $18. So answer is $18. But let me make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\nAnother way: total eggs per day is 16. She eats 3, so 16 - 3 = 13. Then she uses 4 for muffins, so 13 - 4 = 9. Multiply by 2: 9*2=18. Yep, that seems right. So the answer is $18. Answer: [18]\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [18]",
