Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if the blue fiber takes 2 bolts, then the white fiber should take half of that. Half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. So, the white fiber is 1 bolt.\n\nNow, adding the blue and white bolts together. The blue is 2 and the white is 1. So, 2 + 1 equals 3. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If half of 2 is 1, then yes, adding them gives 3. I think that's correct. No steps missed here. The key was understanding that \"half that much\" means half of the quantity given for the other color. So, 2 + 1 = 3. Yep, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 3",
