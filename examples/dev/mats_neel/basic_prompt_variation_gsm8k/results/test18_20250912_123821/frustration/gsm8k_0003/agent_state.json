I need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new value of the house after the repairs. The original value is $80,000, and the value increased by 150%. To find the new value, I think I need to calculate 150% of the original value and add it to the original value. \n\nSo, 150% of $80,000. Let me convert that percentage to a decimal. 150% is the same as 1.5. So, 1.5 multiplied by $80,000. Let me do that calculation. 80,000 times 1.5. Hmm, 80,000 times 1 is 80,000, and 80,000 times 0.5 is 40,000. Adding those together gives 120,000. So the new value is $120,000.\n\nNow, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. The problem says he bought the house for $80,000 and put in $50,000 in repairs. Wait, does that mean he sold the house for $120,000 and paid $80,000 for the house and $50,000 for repairs? Or is the $50,000 repair part of the cost?\n\nWait, the problem says he buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total cost to him is $80,000 (house) plus $50,000 (repairs) which is $130,000. Then, the value increased by 150%, so the selling price is $120,000. Therefore, the profit would be the selling price minus the total cost. \n\nSo, profit = selling price - total cost. Selling price is $120,",
