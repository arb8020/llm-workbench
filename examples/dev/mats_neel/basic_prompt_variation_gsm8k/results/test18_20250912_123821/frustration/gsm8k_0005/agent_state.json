The problem says she gives 15 cups in the morning, 25 cups in the afternoon, and then we need to find out how much is in the final meal. The flock size is 20 chickens. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total amount of feed given each meal. The problem says she feeds each chicken three cups. So, if there are 20 chickens, then each meal would have 20 chickens multiplied by 3 cups. Let me check that. \n\nSo, total feed per meal would be 20 chickens * 3 cups per chicken. Let me calculate that. 20 times 3 is 60. So, each meal has 60 cups. But wait, the problem mentions two meals: morning and afternoon. The final meal is after the afternoon. So, the total feed given in the day would be the sum of the morning, afternoon, and final meal. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-read the problem. It says she gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, 15 cups, afternoon 25 cups. How many cups in the final meal? So, the final meal is the third one. So, if the morning and afternoon are 15 and 25, then the final meal would be 60 cups. Because each chicken is given 3 cups per meal. \n\nBut let me confirm. If each chicken is given 3 cups, then for 20 chickens, that's 20*3=60. So, each meal has 60 cups. Since there are three meals, the total would be 15+25+60=100. But the question is asking for the final meal. So, the answer is 60 cups. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the problem is asking for the final meal's amount, which would be the third one. So, yes, 60. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"how many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day\". So, since she feeds them in three meals, the final meal is the third one. Therefore, the answer is 60. \n\nI",
