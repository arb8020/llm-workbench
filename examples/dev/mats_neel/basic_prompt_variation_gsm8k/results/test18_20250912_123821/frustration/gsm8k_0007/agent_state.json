We need to find out how many sheep Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep.\n\nFirst, let me break it down step by step. The key here is to find the number of sheep each person has and then add them up. Starting with Seattle, since she has 20 sheep, that's straightforward. Then, Charleston has 4 times as many as Seattle. So, 4 times 20 would be... let me calculate that. 4 multiplied by 20 is 80. So, Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nNext, Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston. Since we already found out that Charleston has 80 sheep, then Toulouse would have 2 times that, which is 160 sheep. Let me check that again. 80 times 2 is indeed 160. Okay, so Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, to find the total number of sheep for all three, we need to add up Toulouse's, Charleston's, and Seattle's sheep. So, 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle). Let me add those numbers. 160 plus 80 is 240, and then adding 20 more gives 260. So, the total is 260 sheep.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Let me go through each step again. Seattle has 20. Charleston is 4 times Seattle, so 4*20=80. Toulouse is twice Charleston, so 2*80=160. Adding them all together: 20 + 80 + 160. Let me add 20 and 80 first, which is 100, and then adding 160 gives 260. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The answer should be 260.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [260]",
