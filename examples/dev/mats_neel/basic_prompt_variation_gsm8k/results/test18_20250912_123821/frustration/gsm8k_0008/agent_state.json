At that point, Windows restarts, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart from the beginning. The question is asking how much load it takes to download the entire file.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of the file is downloaded before the restart. Since it's halfway, that's half of 200 GB. Let me calculate that. Half of 200 is 100 GB. So Carla downloads 100 GB normally, right?\n\nBut wait, there's a restart that takes 20 minutes. So after the halfway point, she has to start over. But does that mean the total time is the time to download the first half plus the time to restart? Or does the restart affect the time she actually spends downloading?\n\nLet me think. Normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute. So the time to download the first 100 GB normally would be 100 divided by 2, which is 50 minutes. But then, when she restarts, that takes 20 minutes. So total time would be 50 minutes plus 20 minutes? But wait, does the restart count as part of the download time? Or does it take an extra 20 minutes after the restart?\n\nWait, the problem says that after the restart, she has to restart from the beginning. So the restart itself is 20 minutes, and then she starts over. So the total time would be the time to download the first half (50 minutes) plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download the remaining half (another 50 minutes). But wait, does the restart affect the download time? Or does it take an additional 20 minutes?\n\nWait, the problem says \"how load does it take to download the file?\" So maybe they want the total time, considering the restart. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download",
