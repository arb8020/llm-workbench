She has 20 chickens, so I need to figure out how many cups that would be for all the chickens. \n\nFirst, the problem says she gives each chicken three cups. So, if there are 20 chickens, then 20 multiplied by 3. Let me check that. 20 times 3 is 60. So, that would be 60 cups in total for all the chickens.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions three separate meals. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, afternoon 25 cups. So maybe the final meal is the last one? But the question is asking for the final meal's amount. Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem says: \"In the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?\" So, the total feed given is 15 + 25 + ...? But if each chicken gets 3 cups, then total per day is 20 * 3. But maybe the 15 and 25 are the first two meals, and the final meal is the third one. But the question is asking for the final meal. So, maybe the answer is 3 cups per chicken times 20 chickens, which is 60. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 15 and 25 are the first two meals, and the final meal is the third. So, total feed given is 15 + 25 + (3 cups per chicken * 20 chickens). So that would be 15 + 25 + 60 = 100. But the question is asking for the final meal. So, if the final meal is the third one, then it's 60 cups. But maybe the 15 and 25 are the first two meals, and the final meal is the third. So, yes, 3 * 20 = 60. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to check if the 15 and 25 are per meal. Let me read again:\n\n\"In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.
