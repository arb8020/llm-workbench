                "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses for his new apartment. The first glass costs $5, and every second glass costs 60% of the first one. Hmm, so the prices are not all the same. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first glass is $5. Then, the second glass is 60% of $5, which is 0.6 times 5. Let me calculate that. 0.6 times 5 is 3. So the second glass costs $3. Then the third glass would be 60% of the second glass's price, which is 0.6 times 3. Let me do that: 0.6 * 3 = 1.8. So the third glass is $1.80. \n\nContinuing this pattern, each subsequent glass is 60% of the previous one. So the prices are $5, $3, $1.80, $1.08, $0.648, and so on. Wait, but does this pattern continue infinitely? Or does it stop at 16 glasses? The problem says he wants to buy 16 glasses, so I need to calculate up to the 16th one.\n\nBut maybe there's a formula here. Let me think. Since each glass is 60% of the previous one, this is a geometric sequence where the first term (a) is $5, and each term is multiplied by 0.6. So the nth term (a_n) can be calculated as a * (0.6)^(n-1). \n\nSo for n=1, a_1 = 5. For n=2, a_2 = 5 * 0.6 = 3. For n=3, a_3 = 3 * 0.6 = 1.8, and so on. Therefore, the total cost for 16 glasses would be the sum of the first 16 terms of this geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to calculate this without calculating each term individually. Let me think. The sum of a geometric series is S = a * (r^n - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.",
