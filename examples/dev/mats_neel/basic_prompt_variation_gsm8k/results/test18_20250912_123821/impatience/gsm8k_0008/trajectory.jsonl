{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally, she can download 2 GB per minute. But there's a problem when she's halfway through. At that point, Windows forces a restart, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart from the beginning. The question is asking how much load it takes to download the entire file.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much of the file is downloaded before the restart. Since it's halfway, that's half of 200 GB. Let me calculate that. Half of 200 is 100 GB. So Carla downloads 100 GB normally, right?\n\nBut wait, there's a restart that takes 20 minutes. So after the halfway point, she has to start over. But does that mean the total time is just the time to download the remaining 100 GB plus the 20 minutes? Let me check.\n\nSo normally, downloading 100 GB would take 100 GB divided by 2 GB per minute. That's 50 minutes. But then, after the restart, she has to start from the beginning again. So the total time would be 50 minutes plus 20 minutes. That would be 70 minutes total. But wait, is there any other time she spends? Like, maybe the restart itself? Let me make sure.\n\nThe problem says that the restart takes 20 minutes. So after the halfway point, she restarts, which takes 20 minutes. Then she starts from the beginning again. So the total time is the time to download the first half (50 minutes) plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download the second half (another 50 minutes). Wait, but does she download the second half again? Or is the restart the only thing that takes time?\n\nWait, the problem says she restarts from the beginning. So after the restart, she starts from the beginning again. So the total time would be the time to download the first half (50 minutes) plus the 20 minutes for the restart, plus the time to download the second half (50 minutes). But does that make sense?\n\nWait, but maybe the restart doesn't affect the download time. Because once she restarts, she starts from the beginning again.
