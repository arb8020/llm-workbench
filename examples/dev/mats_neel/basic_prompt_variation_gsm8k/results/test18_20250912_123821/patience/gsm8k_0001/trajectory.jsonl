{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem into parts. Let's start with the eggs she eats. She eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. But wait, does that mean she eats three eggs each day? Or does she eat three eggs each morning and then another three for breakfast the next day? Hmm, the problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning. So maybe she eats three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market. But the question is about how much she makes at the market. So first, let's figure out how many eggs she has each day.\n\nWait, the problem says she lays 16 eggs per day. So that's the total eggs per day. Then she eats three for breakfast. But does that mean she eats three eggs each day? Or does she eat three eggs each morning? The wording is \"eats three for breakfast every morning.\" So maybe she eats three eggs each morning, and then the rest go to the market. But then again, if she lays 16 eggs per day, and eats three for breakfast, then the remaining eggs would be 16 - 3 = 13 eggs. But then she also bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Wait, does that mean she uses four eggs for baking? Or does she use four eggs per day for baking? Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" So \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" So does that mean she uses four eggs for baking? So total eggs per day: 16. She eats three for breakfast, then uses four eggs for baking. So total eggs used per day would be 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7 eggs. Then the remaining eggs would be 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. So total money made would be 9 * 2 = $18.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.
