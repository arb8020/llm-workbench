Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the robe uses 2 bolts of blue fiber. Now, they mention half that much white fiber. So, half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If blue is 2, then half of that is 1. So, the white fiber is 1 bolt. \n\nSo, adding the blue and white bolts together, that would be 2 + 1 = 3 bolts. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 3. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem says \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if blue is 2, then white is half of 2, which is indeed 1. Adding them gives 3. Yeah, that seems correct. So the answer should be 3.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 3",
