I need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the new value of the house after the repairs. The value increased by 150%, so that means the original value plus 150% of the original value. Let me write that down.\n\nOriginal value is $80,000. The increase is 150% of that. So, 150% of $80,000 is... let me calculate that. 150% is the same as 1.5 times the original value. So, 1.5 * 80,000. Let me do that multiplication. 80,000 * 1.5. Hmm, 80,000 * 1 is 80,000, and 80,000 * 0.5 is 40,000. Adding those together gives 120,000. So the new value is $120,000.\n\nNow, the profit is the selling price minus the cost. Wait, but does he sell the house for the new value? The problem says he buys the house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. So, the repairs are part of the cost. So, the profit would be the selling price (which is the new value, $120,000) minus the cost of the house ($80,000) and the repairs ($50,000). Wait, but does the repairs count as part of the cost or as a separate expense?\n\nWait, the problem says he buys the house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. So, the total cost to him is $80,000 (house) plus $50,000 (repairs) which is $130,000. Then, the value increased by 150%, so the selling price is $120,00",
