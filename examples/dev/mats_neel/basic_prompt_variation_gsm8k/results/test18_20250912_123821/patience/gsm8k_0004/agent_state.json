Hmm, so first, I should figure out how many total meters he runs each week. \n\nSince he does 3 sprints a week, and each sprint is 60 meters, I think I just multiply 3 by 60. Let me check that. If he runs 3 times a week, and each time he runs 60 meters, then yes, it's 3 multiplied by 60. \n\nWait, let me write that down to make sure. 3 sprints * 60 meters per sprint = total meters. So 3 * 60. Let me calculate that. 3 times 60 is 180. So James runs 180 meters a week. \n\nIs there anything else I need to consider here? Like, does he run 3 times a week, so maybe 3 times a week, so 3 times 60. Yeah, that seems straightforward. I don't think there's any trick here. The problem is pretty simple. \n\nSo the answer should be 180 meters. Let me just confirm once more. 3 sprints * 60 meters = 180 meters. Yep, that's right. So the final answer is 180.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 180",
