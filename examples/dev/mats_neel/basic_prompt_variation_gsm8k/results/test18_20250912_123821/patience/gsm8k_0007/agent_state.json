The problem says that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many as Seattle. Also, Seattle has 20 sheep. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Seattle has 20 sheep.\n- Charleston has 4 times as many as Seattle. So, if Seattle has 20, then Charleston's sheep would be 4 * 20. Let me calculate that. 4 times 20 is 80. So, Charleston has 80 sheep.\n\nThen, Toulouse has twice as many as Charleston. So, Toulouse's sheep would be 2 * 80. Let me do that multiplication. 2 times 80 is 160. So, Toulouse has 160 sheep.\n\nNow, to find the total number of sheep for all three, I need to add up Toulouse's, Charleston's, and Seattle's sheep. That would be 160 (Toulouse) + 80 (Charleston) + 20 (Seattle). Let me add those numbers. 160 + 80 is 240, and then adding 20 more gives 260. \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with Seattle's sheep: 20. Charleston's: 4 * 20 = 80. Toulouse's: 2 * 80 = 160. Total: 20 + 80 + 160. Let's add 20 + 80 first, which is 100, and then 100 + 160 is 260. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI think that's all. So the answer should be 260. Let me just write that in the required format: Answer: [260]\n</think>\n\nAnswer: [260]",
