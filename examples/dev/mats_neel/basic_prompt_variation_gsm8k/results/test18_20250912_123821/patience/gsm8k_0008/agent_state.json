At that point, Windows restarts, which takes 20 minutes. Then she has to restart from the beginning. The question is asking how much time it takes to download the entire file.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much time it takes for her to download the file normally, and then adjust for the restart. But wait, the problem says that after the restart, she has to start from the beginning. So maybe the total time is the time to download the first half plus the time to download the second half, but since she restarts after halfway, maybe the time is split differently?\n\nLet me break it down. Normally, she downloads 2 GB per minute. The total file is 200 GB. So normally, the time would be 200 divided by 2, which is 100 minutes. But here, she's halfway through, so maybe the download speed is reduced? Wait, but the problem says that normally she can download 2 GB/minute. But when she's halfway, the download speed is 2 GB/minute? Or does the speed decrease?\n\nWait, the problem says \"normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.\"\n\nSo, when she's halfway through, the download speed is 2 GB/minute? Or does the speed decrease? Hmm. The problem says \"normally she can download 2 GB/minute\". So maybe that's the normal speed. But when she's halfway, the speed is 2 GB/minute? Or maybe the speed is slower? Wait, the problem says that 40% of the way through the download, but the download speed is 2 GB/minute. So maybe the download speed is 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through, which is 80 GB, so she can't download the remaining 120 GB? Or maybe the download speed is 2 GB/minute, but she can't download the remaining 120 GB because of the restart?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the",
