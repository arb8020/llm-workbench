  "question": "Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?",
  "gold_answer": "Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.\nHis average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.\nHis total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.\n#### 52",
  "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Jared starts at 47 WPM and then increases to 52 WPM after some lessons. Then he continues increasing by 5 words. The question is asking for the average of the three measurements. Hmm, so first, I need to figure out what each measurement is and then take the average.\n\nFirst, the initial speed is 47 WPM. Then after the lessons, it's 52 WPM. Then he increases by 5 words again. Wait, does \"increasing by 5 words\" mean that each time he tests, the speed increases by 5? So after the first test, he increases by 5, so the next time he tests, his speed is 47 + 5 = 52? Then the third measurement would be 52 + 5 = 57? Let me check that.\n\nSo, the three measurements would be 47, 52, and 57. Then, to find the average, I need to add them up and divide by 3. Let me do that calculation.\n\nFirst, add 47 + 52. Let's see, 47 + 52. 40 +",
