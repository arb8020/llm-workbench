After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. So Jared's typing speed started at 47 WPM and then increased to 52 WPM after some lessons. Then he wants to keep increasing it by 5 words each time. The question is asking for the average of the three measurements: the original speed, the increased speed after the first lesson, and the speed after the second increase.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the problem correctly. Let me break it down. The initial speed is 47 WPM. Then after the first increase, it's 52. Then he increases it another 5 words, so that would be 52 plus 5, which is 57 WPM. Now, we need to find the average of these three numbers: 47, 52, and 57. \n\nTo find the average, I remember that the average is the sum of the numbers divided by the number of measurements. There are three measurements here, so I should add them up and then divide by 3.\n\nLet me add them step by step. Starting with 47 plus 52. Hmm, 47 + 50 is 97, and then plus 2 is"}
