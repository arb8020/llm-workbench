Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Then she sells the remainder at $2 per egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many eggs she eats each day. She eats three for breakfast and four for baking muffins. Wait, does that mean she eats three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking? Let me check the problem again. It says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Hmm, maybe \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" means she uses four eggs for baking? Or does \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" mean she uses four eggs each day? The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think.\n\nIf she eats three eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins with four eggs, then maybe she uses three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking. So total eggs consumed each day would be 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. Then the remainder would be 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Then she sells those 9 eggs at $2 per egg. So total money made would be 9 * 2 = $18.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says \"She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four.\" So maybe \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" means she uses four eggs each day for baking? So total eggs per day: 3 (breakfast) + 4 (baking) = 7. Then remainder is 16 - 7 = 9. Multiply by $2 per egg: 9 * 2 = $18. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\" means she uses four eggs for baking, so same as before. So yes, 9 eggs * $2 = $18. So the answer should be $18.\n\nBut let me check again. Total eggs per day: 16. She eats 3 for breakfast and bakes 4. So 3 + 4 = 7.
