The problem says a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to find out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mention \"half that much white fiber.\" So, if the blue fiber takes 2 bolts, then the white fiber should take half of that. Half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. So, the white fiber is 1 bolt. \n\nNow, adding the blue and white bolts together: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed is 3. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If blue is 2, white is half, so 1. Total is 3. Yep, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.
