She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
  "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
  "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. So, that's the base rate. Then she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. And the remainder is sold at the market for $2 per egg. \n\nWait, so I need to calculate the total eggs she uses for breakfast and for baking, then subtract that from the total eggs laid, and then multiply by the",
