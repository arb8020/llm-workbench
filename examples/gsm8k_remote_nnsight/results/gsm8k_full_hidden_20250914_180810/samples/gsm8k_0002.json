  "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
  "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
  "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to figure out how many bolts in total it takes. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the robe uses 2 bolts of blue fiber. Now, they mention half that much white fiber. So, half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If blue takes 2 bolts, then half of that is 1 bolt. So total bolts would be blue plus white. But wait, does \"half that much\" mean",
