  "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",
  "gold_answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000",
  "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Josh buys a house for $80,000 and puts in $50,000 in repairs. The problem says that this increased the value of the house by 150%. I need to find his profit. Hmm, profit usually means the amount he made after subtracting the cost from the selling price, right? But let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nFirst, the initial cost of the house is $80,000. Then he spends $50,000 on repairs. The value increased by 150%.",
