  "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
  "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
  "model_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet has ducks that lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three eggs for breakfast and bakes muffins for her friends each day with four. Then she sells the remaining eggs at $2 per fresh duck egg. I need to figure out how much she makes every day at the farmers' market.\n\nFirst, I should calculate how many eggs she eats each day. She eats three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking muffins. Wait, does that mean she eats three eggs for breakfast and four eggs for baking, so total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs per day",
