Collect Results from Distributed GSM8K Experiment

This script collects experiment results from remote workers back to the local machine.

WORKFLOW GAP IDENTIFIED:
1. launch_experiment.py - deploys workers and starts experiment ‚úÖ
2. monitor_experiment.py - shows real-time progress via log streaming ‚úÖ  
3. collect_results.py - pulls back result files from remote workers ‚ùå MISSING
4. analyze_results.py - analyzes collected results ‚úÖ (but fails without #3)

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Results are written to remote worker machines in: /tmp/output_dir/{variant}/{sample_id}/
- analyze_results.py expects results in local: results/{experiment_name}/{variant}/{sample_id}/
- No automated way to transfer results from remote to local
- Users must manually scp/rsync from each worker

PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION:
This script should:
1. Read experiment config from results/{experiment_name}/experiment_config.json
2. For each worker in config.workers_info:
   - Connect via worker.ssh_connection (using BifrostClient)
   - Locate remote output directory (config.output_dir)  
   - Create tar archive of results on remote machine
   - Download tar file to local results directory
   - Extract and organize by variant/sample structure
   - Verify all expected samples were collected
   - Clean up remote tar files
3. Handle network failures with retry logic
4. Show progress bar for large result sets
5. Validate result completeness (check for missing samples)

USAGE:
    python collect_results.py results/experiment_name_timestamp/
    python collect_results.py results/experiment_name_timestamp/ --worker-subset worker_1,worker_2
    python collect_results.py results/experiment_name_timestamp/ --verify-only

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:
- Workers that have already been terminated (graceful failure)
- Partial results (some samples failed)
- Network interruptions during download
- Disk space issues on local machine
- Conflicting results (if script run multiple times)

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- Should work with existing BifrostClient for SSH connections
- Should read same experiment config format as other scripts
- Should create same directory structure that analyze_results.py expects
- Could be automatically triggered by monitor_experiment.py when all workers complete

This fills the critical gap in the experiment workflow and enables fully automated 
distributed evaluation without manual file copying.
