Still, the decision to seek professional help can be difficult and painful for a parent. The first step is to gently try to talk to the child. An honest open talk about feelings can often help. Parents may choose to consult with the child's physicians, teachers, members of the clergy, or other adults who know the child well. These steps may resolve the problems for the child and family.\nFollowing are a few signs which may indicate that a child and adolescent psychiatric evaluation will be useful.\n- Marked fall in school performance\n- Poor grades in school despite trying very hard\n- Severe worry or anxiety, as shown by regular refusal to go to school, go to sleep or take part in activities that are normal for the child's age\n- Frequent physical complaints\n- Hyperactivity; fidgeting; constant movement beyond regular playing with or without difficulty paying attention\n- Persistent nightmares\n- Persistent disobedience or aggression (longer than 6 months) and provocative opposition to authority figures\n- Frequent, unexplainable temper tantrums\n- Threatens to harm or kill oneself\n- Marked decline in school performance\n- Inability to cope with problems and daily activities\n- Marked changes in sleeping and/or eating habits\n- Extreme difficulties in concentrating that get in the way at school or at home\n- Sexual acting out\n- Depression shown by sustained, prolonged negative mood and attitude, often accompanied by poor appetite, difficulty sleeping or thoughts of death\n- Severe mood swings\n- Strong worries or anxieties that get in the way of daily life, such as at school or socializing\n- Repeated use of alcohol and/or drugs\n- Intense fear of becoming obese with no relationship to actual body weight, excessive dieting, throwing up or using laxatives to loose weight\n- Persistent nightmares\n- Threats of self-harm or harm to others\n- Self-injury or self destructive behavior\n- Frequent outbursts of anger, aggression\n- Repeated threats to run away\n- Aggressive or non-aggressive consistent violation of rights of others; opposition to authority, truancy, thefts, or vandalism\n- Strange thoughts, beliefs, feelings, or unusual behaviors\nSee other Facts for Families:\n#25 Where to Seek Help for Your Child\n#52 Comprehensive Psychiatric Evaluation\n#57 Normal Adolescent Development, Middle School, and Early High School Years\n#58 Normal Adolescent Development, Late High School Year and Beyond\n#00 Definition of a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist\nThe American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) represents over 8,500 child and adolescent psychiatrists who are physicians with at least five years of additional training beyond medical school in general (adult) and child and adolescent psychiatry.\nFacts for Families\u00a9 information sheets are developed, owned and distributed by AACAP.

Previous abstract Next abstract\nSession 40 - The Interstellar Medium.\nDisplay session, Tuesday, June 09\nGamma Ray Burst (GRB) explosions can make kpc-size shells and holes in the interstellar media (ISM) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10^7 K. Disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter. This differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow-out. Evidence for giant shells with energies of \\sim10^53 ergs are summarized. Some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be GRB remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect. The expected frequency of GRBs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells.\nProgram listing for Tuesday Question: How is bipolar disorder different from unipolar depression or 'regular' depression?\nAnswer: Both bipolar disorder and major depression are typically associated with depressive episodes. So both illnesses are accompanied by depressions. The difference is that in bipolar disorder people also have periods of elevation -- or severe irritability. We call these manic or hypomanic episodes. Making the Case for Action\nThis fact sheet(pdf) and slide deck provide essential state-specific information that addresses the economic imperative, the equity imperative, and the expectations imperative of the college- and career-ready agenda. These resources can be used on their own or serve as the foundation for a personalized presentation or fact sheet(word), which can be customized with state-specific details and examples. The PowerPoint, in particular, was developed with various users in mind and offers a wide range of case-making data that can be drawn from to support your own advocacy efforts.\nAdvancing the Agenda\nAs states continue their efforts to promote college and career readiness, Achieve regularly surveys the states to identify their progress in adopting critical college- and career-ready policies. Below is a summary of Idaho's progress to date:\nSee Closing the Expectations Gap for more information\nState accountability systems focus the efforts of teachers, students, parents, administrators and policymakers to ensure that students and schools meet the established goals, including the goal of ensuring all students graduate ready for college and careers. Idaho has yet to begin to use any of the key college- and career-ready indicators in their accountability system.\n|Annual School-level Public Reporting||Statewide Performance Goals||School-level Incentives||Accountability Formula|\n|Earning a college- and career-ready diploma|\n|Scoring college-ready on a high school assessment|\n|Earning college credit while in high school|\n|Requiring remedial courses in college|\nFor an explanation of the indicators, their uses and Achieve\u2019s minimum criteria for college- and career-ready accountability, see here. A land whose rich cultural heritage is discovered not only from within the walls of numerous museums, galleries and churches, many of which today, as zero category monuments are included in a part of the UNESCO World Heritage List, but also in that magical place on the Mediterranean, where even the shortest stroll becomes a journey down a staircase thousands of years old, which takes one through a history that is at the same time turbulent, exciting and glorious.\nWith as many as seven cultural phenomena- The Festivity of Saint Blaise, lace-making in Lepoglava, Hvar and Pag, the bell ringers from the Kastav region, the Hvar Procession Za Kri\u017eem, (\u2018following the Cross\u2019), two-part singing in the Istrian scale, in Istria and Hrvatsko Primorje, the spring procession of \u2018Ljelje\u2019 and traditional manufacture of wooden toys in the Hrvatsko zagorje region, Croatia is among the countries with the most protected intangible cultural heritage elements, recorded on the UNESCO List.\nThe famous scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), inventor of alternating current.\nWas born in Smiljan, Croatia, died in New York, USA.\nDog breed Dalmatian originates from these areas? In a small Franciscan monastery in Zaostrog, there is a painting from 1724 which for the first time depicts a Dalmatian dog\u2026\nSlavoljub Eduard Penkala\nIn 1906, a Croat Slavoljub Eduard Penkala for the first time applied for a patent for a ballpoint (penkala) and a holder for a fountain pen.\nFrom time immemorial, the tie has been a part of the Croatian national costume, which was preserved by the Croats to the more recent times, who moved to central Europe in the 16th century. It was later taken over by the Croatian soldiers who were fighting in Europe, and a part of their uniform was assumed by the French in the 17th century. Under the leadership of the French \u201eGod of Sun\" Louis XIV there was a horsemen unit, the so-called Royal cravate, who wore mostly red collar ribbons. The custom of wearing ribbons from the Croats dates back to this time, which was later expanded around Europe and the world, and today is inevitably the most important detail in men's fashion, and also an original Croatian souvenir. The word \u00abkravata\u00bb (tie) originates from the word \u00abKroate\u00bb...\nThe world traveler and explorer Marco Polo was born in 1254, most probably on the island of Kor\u010dula. Even today, there are people living on the island with the same last name..\nIsland of Vrnik is situated in the archipelago of the Pelje\u0161ac canal in front of the east coast of Kor\u010dula island, widely known for its stone-pit of quality lime-stone (marble) from which Aia Sofia (Istanbul) and the While House (Washington) were partly built as were some palaces-town halls in Dubrovnik, Stockholm, Venice, Vienna.\nVisit to the fertile plains of Baranja where the grapes have been cultivated for centuries, is not complete if"
